		<li>Originally from New Delhi, India I spent a greater part of my middle school and high school days in Africa, specifically in Ghana and Nigeria.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>I first moved to Accra, Ghana from India at the end of Grade 5, and went on to spend 5 great years in the sunny and quiet little West African Nation.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>The next place I moved to was back to my home town of New Delhi, but this was for just a year. At the end of 11th grade, I moved to Lagos, Nigeria, which is where I finally graduated from high school in June 2018.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>All this moving around gave me the opportunity to understand different countries, cultures, and most importantly, how things were so different yet so similar everywhere. Always converting between currencies and seeing some of the same products being sold in different countries gave me a sense of how interconnected the world economy was, sparking an interest in Economics.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>The highways of modern computer technology, always evolving towards a goal of maximum efficiency, that keep this hugely convoluted system from crashing sparked an interest in Computer Science.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li>At the end of this all, I now find myself a sophomore at UC Berkeley pursuing my two passions and getting a much more real sense of how the world really works.</li>
