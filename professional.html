			While I am proficient in Python and Java, I also have some experience with SQL and like to play with HTML and CSS (which is what this website has been made with).
			<br><br>
			My main interests are Data Science and Computer Vision using Machine Learning, although I do also have some experience with Natural Language Processing, again with elements of Machine Learning.
			<br><br>
			On this page, feel free to look over some of the projects I have done, either in class, at an internship, or on my own.

		<span>Project 1: Gitlet (Java)</span>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="bodyContainerFull">
		<span>
			A version control system similar to Git, I built this program from scratch in Java, when I took CS61BL over Summer 2019.
			<br><br>
			The program comes with most of Git's functionality, such as branching, merging, and checking-out. The basic structure is that of a 'LinkedList' whereby in the same branch, the current and previous commit's commit ID is noted and is then access when a file is checked out.
			<br><br>
			Like Git, there is also a 'head' pointer that points to the 'head' commit, which is usually the most recent commit.

		<span>Project 2: Emotion Bot (Python)</span>

	<div class="bodyContainerFull">
		<span>
			A chatbot that responds based on the emotion of its input I made during my internship at CYST Company Ltd. during the summer of 2019
			<br><br>
			The bot is made using Tensorflow and was hosted on the company's internal platform using Flask.
			<br><br>
			I also developed an emotion classifier that analyzes the input emotion using a Naive Bayes classifier.

		<span>Project 3: Refugee Responsibility and Sustainability Index (Python) - In Progress</span>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="bodyContainerFull">
		<span>
			The RRSI is an index I devised that calculates the level of responsibility a country has to either absorb more refugees or increase its contribution to humanitarian aid. There is more information about the RRSI in the 'Personal-Interests' section.
			<br><br>
			This is my attempt at writing a program that, given the name of a country, returns the level of responsibility. So far, it uses the World Bank's API to access information. 
			<br><br>
			Currently, I am trying to optimize the way I have written the code for the calculation in order to do it as efficiently as possible.
