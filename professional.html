			While I am proficient in Python and Java, I also have some experience with SQL and like to play with HTML and CSS (which is what this website has been made with).
			<br><br>
			My main interests are Data Science and Computer Vision using Machine Learning, although I do also have some experience with Natural Language Processing, again with elements of Machine Learning.
			<br><br>
			On this page, feel free to look over some of the projects I have done, either in class, at an internship, or on my own.

			A version control system similar to Git, I built this program from scratch in Java, when I took CS61BL over Summer 2019.
			<br><br>
			The program comes with most of Git's functionality, such as branching, merging, and checking-out. The basic structure is that of a 'LinkedList' whereby in the same branch, the current and previous commit's commit ID is noted and is then access when a file is checked out.
			<br><br>
			Like Git, there is also a 'head' pointer that points to the 'head' commit, which is usually the most recent commit.
