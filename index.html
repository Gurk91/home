	<h1>Brief Intro</h1>
	<p>My name is Gurkaran Singh Goindi, better known as GK. I am 19 years old, and I am pretty board right now</p>

	<h2>Early Years</h2>
	<p>Tbh, I dont even remember anything before middle schools, so lets just skip this part.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>High School years</h2>
	<p>Honestly, I was in so many highschools, that this is going to take forever to explain</p>
	<br>
	<h3>College</h3>
	<p>I go to UC Berkeley; probably my only noteworthy achievement so far</p>
	<br>
	<p>Tbh, I dont even have big hopes for the future. LMAO</p>
